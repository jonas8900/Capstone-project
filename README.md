# Friends

Welcome to Friends, an app dedicated to organizing regular events for both larger and smaller groups of friends. In the hustle of everyday life, it's easy to lose track of regular meetups and miss out on opportunities within your group. With Friends, my goal is to tackle this issue and make organizing events a breeze.
