# Friends

my app Friends is about organizing regular events in larger and smaller groups of friends. Since regular meetings often get lost in everyday life and you quickly forget what opportunities you have as a group, I have made it my task to solve this problem with this app.

You can enter activities, like them, vote, enter events and maintain a list for each event where you can see which person is taking which item to the event. It is also possible to have different groups of friends. 

This app is still being programmed and is not yet complete, but you can already see a rough direction. 

Thank you very much for your time!
